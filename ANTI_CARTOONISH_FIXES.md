# Anti-Cartoonish Fixes for VeoPrompt-Pro (Optimized)

## Problem Identified
The system was producing cartoonish outcomes because:
1. **No explicit system prompts** - Agents were using default prompts without realism guidance
2. **Weak anti-cartoonish directives** - The template mentioned "realistic" but wasn't strong enough
3. **Missing validation layers** - No specific checks for cartoonish elements

## Optimized Solution (Non-Redundant)

### 1. Concise Agent System Prompts

#### `final_assembly_agent` (Most Critical)
- **Model**: GPT-4o
- **Optimized System Prompt**:
  - "CRITICAL: Every element must be physically realistic and natural. Avoid cartoonish expressions, movements, or behaviors."
  - Focused on core anti-cartoonish directive without redundancy

#### `context_analysis_agent`
- **Model**: Gemini 2.5 Flash
- **Optimized System Prompt**:
  - "Focus on realistic, observable actions. Avoid cartoonish or fantastical elements."
  - Concise but effective realism guidance

#### `character_enrichment_agent`
- **Model**: Gemini 2.5 Flash
- **Optimized System Prompt**:
  - "Focus on realistic facial features and expressions. Avoid exaggerated or cartoonish descriptions."
  - Clear anti-cartoonish directive without over-prompting

#### `camera_enrichment_agent`
- **Model**: Gemini 2.5 Flash
- **Optimized System Prompt**:
  - "Use natural, handheld camera movements. Avoid cinematic or overly polished work."
  - Focused on authentic camera behavior

#### `sounds_enrichment_agent`
- **Model**: Gemini 2.5 Flash
- **Optimized System Prompt**:
  - "Use natural, realistic sounds and dialogue. Avoid cartoonish or exaggerated audio elements."
  - Clear audio realism guidance

#### `realism_filter_agent`
- **Model**: Claude 3.5 Haiku
- **Optimized System Prompt**:
  - "REJECT if contains: exaggerated expressions, cartoonish elements, unrealistic actions, overly dramatic elements, or anything artificial."
  - Concise validation criteria

### 2. Simplified Template (`templates/veoprompt.md.j2`)

#### Key Optimizations:
- **Strong opening**: "This must NOT look cartoonish, animated, or artificial"
- **Concise REALISM REQUIREMENTS** section
- **Removed redundant directives** while maintaining anti-cartoonish emphasis
- **Streamlined section descriptions** with essential realism notes

### 3. Focused Orchestrator Prompts

#### Character Enrichment:
- **Removed redundant anti-cartoonish sections** (already in system prompt)
- **Focused on technical VEO3 guidelines** and 8-second constraints
- **Streamlined input/output format**

#### Camera Enrichment:
- **Removed redundant realism sections** (already in system prompt)
- **Focused on technical camera guidelines** and timing
- **Streamlined input/output format**

#### Sounds Enrichment:
- **Removed redundant audio realism sections** (already in system prompt)
- **Focused on technical audio requirements** and timing
- **Streamlined input/output format**

### 4. Efficient Validation Layers

#### Duration Validation:
- **Concise prompt** focusing only on 8-second limit and VEO3 compatibility
- **Simple INVALID/VALID response format**

#### Anti-Cartoonish Validation:
- **Minimal prompt** leveraging system prompt knowledge
- **Simple REJECT/APPROVE response format**

## Optimization Benefits

### Reduced Redundancy:
- **System prompts** contain core anti-cartoonish directives
- **Orchestrator prompts** focus on technical requirements
- **No duplicate instructions** between system and task prompts

### Improved Efficiency:
- **Shorter prompts** = faster processing
- **Clearer instructions** = better agent focus
- **Reduced token usage** = lower costs

### Maintained Effectiveness:
- **Anti-cartoonish directives** still present in system prompts
- **Validation layers** still catch cartoonish elements
- **Template** still emphasizes realism

## Key Principles Applied

1. **System prompts** = Core behavior and anti-cartoonish directives
2. **Task prompts** = Technical requirements and specific instructions
3. **Validation prompts** = Simple checks leveraging system knowledge
4. **Template** = Concise but clear realism emphasis

## Expected Results

The optimized system should:
1. **Produce realistic content** with less prompt overhead
2. **Avoid cartoonish elements** through focused system prompts
3. **Process faster** with shorter, more focused prompts
4. **Maintain quality** while reducing redundancy
5. **Lower costs** through reduced token usage

## Testing Recommendations

To verify the optimizations work:
1. **Test with various inputs** to ensure anti-cartoonish directives still work
2. **Monitor processing speed** improvements
3. **Check token usage** reduction
4. **Verify output quality** remains high
5. **Ensure validation layers** still catch cartoonish elements
